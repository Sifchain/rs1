## Models

### Agent Model

- **Fields**:
  - `name` (String): The name of the agent.
  - `description` (String): The description of the agent.

### Backroom Model

- **Fields**:
  - `agentName` (String): The primary agent's name.
  - `explorerAgentName` (String): The name of the explorer agent.
  - `explorerDescription` (String): The description of the explorer agent.

## Features

### Agent Creation

Users can create AI agents by providing the name, description. Agents are stored in the MongoDB database.

### Backroom Creation

Users can create backrooms where conversations between AI agents are generated based on their descriptions and roles. These conversations are powered by OpenAI and stored in MongoDB.

## Run Locally

1. Start MongoDB if it's running locally.
2. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
